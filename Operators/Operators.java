        Operator -> Symbols that tell compiler to perform some operation or calculation

        Arithmatic operators -> operates two variables ex. a + b here + is operator adding a and b
             + -> add variables
             - -> subtract variables
             * -> product variables
             / -> Divide variables
             % -> give remainder

             ++ -> increment number by one
             -- -> decrement number by one

             ++a -> preincrement - first change value then use value
             a++ -> postincrement - first use value then change value


             Relational operators - to compare variables these operators return boolean value

               == -> for checking wheather two digits are equal
               != -> for checking wheather two digits are not equal
               > and < -> checks two variable greater or lesser than other
               => and <= -> checks two variable greater or equal to other and lesser or equal to other

            Logical operators - compares two conditions or statements it also returns boolean value
              
              && -> return true only if two statements are true
              || -> return true if atlreast one statement is true
              !  -> switch true to false and vice versa

            Bitwise operator
              
             &  -> returns true if two bits are 1 and false if two bits are 0 or different
             |  -> returns true if two bits are different otherwise returns false
             ^  -> returns false if two bits are same and true with same bits
             ~ -> it switch the bit from true to false and vice versa
             << -> it shifts all bits to left to some space
             >> -> it shifts all bits to right to some space
